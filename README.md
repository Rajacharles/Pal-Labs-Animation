# Pal-Labs-Animation - HTML5 & CSS3 Animation

Pal labs Animation provides a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties. Instead of having property changes take effect immediately, you can cause the changes in a property to take place over a period of time. Animations that involve transitioning between two states are often called implicit transitions as the states in between the start and final states are implicitly defined by the browser.
